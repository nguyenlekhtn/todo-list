# todo-list

A todo-list website which I made based on assignments of https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list

Feature of this todo-list:
- add projects and change these info
- add tasks to project and change those info

what I practiced in this project:
* Using webpack to bundling the web app
* Using [aria-current] attribute to set the active state of an element
* Using <dialog> to show a popup in page
* Change display attribute to show/hide element
